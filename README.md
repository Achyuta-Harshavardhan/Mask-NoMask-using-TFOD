# Object Detection using TFOD:

1. In this project i had trained the model for real time face mask detection using Tensorflow Object Detection(TFOD)
2. SSDlite model as it offered me with the best accuracy and descent FPS as you can see in testing.
3. I had trained the model for 150000 steps to obtain the best accuracy in google colab and later make use of frozen inference graph for the prediction.
